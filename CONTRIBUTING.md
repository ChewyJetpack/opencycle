We encourage pull requests from anyone. To do so, please fork and clone this repo.
You work should then be done on a new feature branch. Once ready please

with your changes.

Once Travis has passed we will try to review your request as soon as possible.

Please keep in mind:

* Write tests
* Follow the PSR-2 style guide
* Add a detailed commit message
